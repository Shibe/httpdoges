## About

This is the website that is hosted at [https://dogehttp.codes](https://dogehttp.codes).

This version does not need any server side code and is written in dogescript.

## Adding a new image

Currently not all HTTP status codes are covered. You are welcome to create an issue or PR to cover them.

We've prepared a [template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DgEXFqptMwm8hOfDCVCFWmvFkJnHC_1J/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=109620135719354629440&rtpof=true&sd=true) to make this easier.

You can clone it, replace the information with the new one and export as a JPG image. Then, upload it to `/assets/images`.
